# Memories memory

Project created from pure html,css and javascript

## Ideas about the project

My idear is to develop a system where people can upload their own pictures to use as memory images. For each time a card is flipped I show a portion of the image. Like 1/4 of the image. After a while the level of difficulty decreases and more of the image is shown, but giving less points. Because of this the people sharing the memory can benefit from knowing what kind of memory the picture are based on.

### structure

the project is base on core activities as board.js player.js and everything is triggered through clicking. I have made the project as selv explanatory as possible.

### Installing

Just access index.html to start the game
